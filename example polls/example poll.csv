"2023/06/10 3:46:52 AM AST","REDACTED","6","3","2","4","7 (Most Preferred)","1 (Least Preferred)","5","Yes.","Its only a little thing but I remember we had a couple of missions where our squadron task was a bit out of our capabilities. Unfortunately the airframe we fly is outdated in technology and we can do only basic air to ground. Our lack of sensors really makes it difficult to find ground targets during night and/or bad weather conditions. We can still do some air to ground during these conditions but we are very limited on what we can do. I think since all mission devs fly modern aircraft their different sensors and tools available to them get taken for granted a bit and they don't realize that some planes don't have those. I think having a mission dev ask squadron leadership about their tasking for that week keeping in mind their aircraft capabilities and squadron skill level would improve the overall mission experience for some players. I've received some feedback from my squadron mates about some missions being too difficult to perform because the are beyond our aircraft capabilities. I think this opens an opportunity of working with other squadrons, ie. buddy lasing and marking targets using smoke/flares, which would be more fun as well. Thank you!"
